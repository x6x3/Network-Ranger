# üåê Network Ranger - WiFi Optimization Tool

A powerful C++ tool designed to optimize WiFi network performance, perform speed tests, and connect to nearby bridges for enhanced network connectivity.

##  Features

- **Network Discovery**: Scan and discover available WiFi networks
- **Speed Testing**: Perform comprehensive speed tests using Speedtest.net API
- **Network Optimization**: Optimize DNS, TCP, and WiFi settings for better performance
- **Bridge Connection**: Connect to nearby network bridges for extended coverage
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor network performance in real-time
- **Network Analysis**: Analyze current network status and provide recommendations

## üìã Requirements

- C++11 or higher
- libcurl (for HTTP requests)
- jsoncpp (for JSON parsing)
- POSIX-compliant system (Linux/macOS)

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

Install required dependencies:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev build-essential

# macOS
brew install curl jsoncpp

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install libcurl-devel jsoncpp-devel gcc-c++
```

### Compilation

```bash
# Compile the project
make

# Or compile manually
g++ -std=c++11 -o network_ranger ranger.c++ -lcurl -ljsoncpp -lpthread
```

## üéØ Usage

Run the Network Ranger tool:

```bash
./network_ranger
```

### Menu Options

1. **Scan Available Networks** - Discover nearby WiFi networks
2. **Perform Speed Test** - Test download/upload speeds and ping
3. **Optimize Network** - Apply network optimizations
4. **Connect to Bridge** - Connect to nearby network bridges
5. **Analyze Network** - Analyze current network performance
6. **Start Monitoring** - Begin real-time network monitoring
7. **Show Network Info** - Display current network information
8. **Exit** - Close the application

## üîß Network Optimizations

The tool performs several optimizations:

- **DNS Optimization**: Uses Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) and Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1)
- **TCP Optimization**: Increases TCP window size and enables TCP fast open
- **WiFi Optimization**: Selects optimal channels and adjusts transmit power
- **Bridge Connection**: Connects to nearby bridges for extended coverage

##  Speed Testing

The tool integrates with Speedtest.net API to provide accurate speed measurements:

- Download speed testing
- Upload speed testing
- Ping measurement
- Server selection
- ISP identification

## Bridge Connection

Network Ranger can detect and connect to nearby network bridges:

- Automatic bridge discovery
- Secure connection establishment
- Performance monitoring
- Automatic failover
